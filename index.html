    <h1>My Compilation of Poems!</h1>
    <p>As the title implies, this website serves to showcase  the poems I've made so far. From boredom, to a random epiphany of sequence of words, to a surge of emotion, lots of reasons exist as to why I write and make.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <h1>But there ought to be more from this, right?</h1>
    <p>For you, no. For me, yes. As of making this project, this will serve me two purpose: brag (or bask the world in cringe) my poems for the world to see, and to test how well I fare with web dev as I am right now. I only know HTML, CSS, JS, and a bit of Python, and I suck at all of them, as highly evident from this website. <br><br> Still, I try, and that is all that matters. While making this project, this will be an endeavor which tests me, but when it's done, it will serve as a permanent benchmark for my future self and other people. <br><br> Feel free to go through this website and read my poems. Go to the About Me page, scroll till you find the form, and write about how much I suck at writing or web dev (or both).</p>
