    <h1>Peter John Feraer</h1>
    <p>I am an English major, and I graduated from Cavite State University. <br><br>I finished my last semester sometime in July 2025, and when the dust settled, everyone from our batch have already made their chess moves. <br><br>Some have been employed way before the semester concluded, while some were already on their way to getting their first job ever. Things were not so good for me though, as job opportunities continue to elude me here and there. <br><br>From being ghosted by HRs, to being rejected by random companies, the gap between me and my colleagues widen.</p>

    <h1>BIG UPDATE</h1>
    <p>On the 10th of September 2025, I finally got hired as a part-time instructor. The first days felt miserable however, as I am not one to quickly adapt on changes and new demands. <br><br> To be honest, I do not think that I am going to keep on making small projects like this. In the first place, this was just my means to remain attractive to HRs; through constant improvement. I may have to do this again someday though, since web development is just one of the skills I have to attain for my ultimate goal.<br><br>For now, I am going to do my best at my new work. Maybe I will get some accolades along the way, but who knows. The only thing I am certain about is that my life is not going to stop here.</p>
